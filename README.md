Version 1.0 (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)

By [The Insight Lab](http://insight.cis.rit.edu) at the Rochester Institute of Technology


StaffInSight is the perfect tool to help your lab or small company manage staff with potentially diverse schedules, manage who can handle equipment, manage which staff has what skills, and manage any events your company may hold. 

Use it on your smartphone or web browser! StaffInSight is designed for easy navigation and quick information display:

See all the skills that apply to your company, and the staff that possess them:
![SIS Skills](/images/skills.jpg "Skills")



Quickly see the status of any equipment your lab or company owns. See who is in charge of managing that equipment, and any staff that is trained to handle the equipment:
![SIS Equipment](/images/equipment.jpg "Equipment")



Admin users can edit any profile with that staff-person's equipment handling and skills information:

Is your company or lab hosting an event? Specify to StaffInSight the name, location, and date of the event, as well as the equipment and skills necessary for the event. StaffInSight will use the information you provide it to generate a list of the best potential employees for your event (that satisfy the event's requirements). Choose who you want from that list, and StaffInSight will email the staff asking if they are available to attend. "Recruited" staff are able to respond with the simple click of a link in their email, and your RSVP list is generated automatically! With StaffInSight, managing diverse staff scheduling becomes a second thought!
